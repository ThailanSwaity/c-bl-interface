# c-bl-interface
An extremely simple bluetooth GUI library on linux written in C. 
Works with BlueZ using glib's GDBus C bindings.

I had been experiencing pain connecting and disconnecting common things like my earbuds.
So I wrote up this simple application to help solve that problem.

At some point I would like to add more features, like scanning and connecting to new devices, but for now this works enough for me
